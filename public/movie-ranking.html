<h1> Best Movies & Series According to ALi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time: </h2>
<hr />
<ol>

<li><h3>Stranger Things</h3></li>
<p>Really great series of a girl who was part of doctors experiment and got power more then any other and then saved them from the enemy.</p>

<li><h3>The Witch </h3></li>
<p>This is also a great movie in which a witch kills the bad enemy with his powers.</p>

<li><h3>The Super Girl</h3></li>
<p> This Series also one of my favourite in which a girl has superpowers with them she save poeple from bad guys.</p>
